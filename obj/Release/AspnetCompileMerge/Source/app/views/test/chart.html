                            A radar chart is a way of showing multiple data points and the variation between them.

                            They are often useful for comparing the points of two or more different data sets.

                            For a radar chart, to provide context of what each point means, we include an array of strings that show around each point in the chart.
                            For the radar chart data, we have an array of datasets. Each of these is an object, with a fill colour, a stroke colour, a colour for the fill of each point, and a colour for the stroke of each point. We also have an array of data values.
